IoT devices, including sensors and communication systems, are deployed along the water pipeline network. These sensors can monitor various parameters like pressure, flow rate, and temperature. The collected data is transmitted to a central system for analysis and leak detection.

The Hydraulic Models for No leak Scenarios can be further linked to remodel the leaked Conditions based on Real World to Monitor the health of Water Supply System. 

The detected leaks and relevant information are displayed on a map using GIS visualization techniques. This provides a clear overview of the pipeline network and the location of leaks. Additionally, an alert system can be implemented to notify relevant personnel in real-time when a leak is detected.
